## Overview

The movie_seat_24080CA app is designed to provide users with a curated list of movies and facilitate seat selection for each movie. It comprises two primary features: the movie display and seat selection functions.

### Features

- **Movie Display:** Users can view essential details such as title, rating, duration, and a brief description for each movie.
- **Glide Image Loader:** The app leverages Glide Image loader to fetch and present movie posters sourced from myvue.com, enhancing the visual experience.

### Seat Selection

When users interact with a movie, they are directed to the MovieActivity screen, where they can adjust seat selections using intuitive plus and minus icons. The app dynamically updates seat availability and displays a "filling fast" badge when seats are limited, providing users with real-time information.

## Challenges Faced

During development, challenges were encountered, particularly in efficiently managing image loading processes and seamless data transfer between different screens within the app. These hurdles were successfully navigated by leveraging valuable insights from online resources and strategically implementing the Glide Image loader, thereby optimizing image loading tasks and ensuring smooth functionality across all app features.

## Key Learnings

This project has been an invaluable learning experience for me, significantly augmenting my expertise in Android app development, UI/UX design principles, and effective problem-solving strategies. Key learnings from this experience encompass enhanced data management practices between app components, the development of robust troubleshooting skills, the utilization of visually engaging elements to boost user engagement, and the effective utilization of online learning resources to continuously enhance my skill set and knowledge base.
